        <h3>Peer Mentor</h3>
        <p>
          In the Fall of 2021 and the Fall of 2022, I was a peer mentor for the Tippie College of Business Direct Admit Seminar. The seminar is a class that helps first-year direct admits transition into college. As a peer mentor, I facilitated weekly discussions to engage with 45 students. The class was also taught with other peer mentors, who I collaborated with during weekly meetings to plan discussions that were impactful to students.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I transitioned into college, my peer mentors were so impactful to me as a Tippie student, and I wanted to provide the same experience to other incoming students. I still love being able to connect with students from my classes and by being a friendly face to say hi to.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Business Student Ambassador</h3>
        <p>
          As a business student ambassador, I guide prospective students and families on tours of the Tippie College of Business. I also share my upper-level business student perspective by serving as a student panelist.
        </p>
        <p>
          Being able to work with prospective Tippie students has been one of the most rewarding parts of my college experience; I share why I chose to come to the University of Iowa, what I am learning in my classes, and why I chose to study Marketing Analytics and Business Analytics. I also remember the impact my tour guides and student ambassadors had on me when I visited in high school and hope to have the same impact on students.
