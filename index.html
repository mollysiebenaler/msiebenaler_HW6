                <p>
                  I am currently a senior studying Marketing and Business Analytics & Information Systems within the Tippie College of Business at the University of Iowa. My interest in studying business sparked during high school when I started my family's business, Luke3DP, on Amazon and Etsy. I became fascinated with the different ways to influence a customer's path to purchase: from analyzing key search terms and click-through rates, to Amazon's algorithms, and taking photos and creating infographics about the products. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  With the passion I have developed for marketing analytics, product marketing, customer experience, and data visualization I have been able to apply my work with Luke3DP to better enjoy my studies at the University of Iowa.
