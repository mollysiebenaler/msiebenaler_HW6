        <p>
          I am currently a senior studying Marketing and Business Analytics & Information Systems within the Tippie College of Business at the University of Iowa. My interest in studying business sparked during high school when I started my family's business, Luke3DP, on Amazon and Etsy. I became fascinated with the different ways to influence a customer's path to purchase: from analyzing key search terms and click-through rates, to Amazon's algorithms, and taking photos and creating infographics about the products.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the passion I have developed for marketing analytics, product marketing, customer experience, and data visualization I have been able to apply my work with Luke3DP to better enjoy my studies at the University of Iowa.

        <h3>Marketing Institute</h3>
        <p>
          In the last three semesters of my college career, I was selected as one of the top 20 marketing students to participate in a field immersion program called the Marketing Institute to work on marketing consulting projects for real clients.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the Spring of 2023, my team created rebranding and strategy guidelines for Growthland and Good Shepherd Center, both local Iowa City businesses. My team's work was chosen by Growthland to be implemented as part of its new marketing strategy.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the Fall of 2023 and this Spring, I have been working with Bobbi-Toads, a children's apparel company. My team is working on conducting primary market research, in the form of a Qualtrics survey and focus groups, to understand parents' preferences in purchasing children's footwear and opinions about Bobbi-Toads products.

        <h3>Peer Mentor</h3>
        <p>
          In the Fall of 2021 and the Fall of 2022, I was a peer mentor for the Tippie College of Business Direct Admit Seminar. The seminar is a class that helps first-year direct admits transition into college. As a peer mentor, I facilitated weekly discussions to engage with 45 students. The class was also taught with other peer mentors, who I collaborated with during weekly meetings to plan discussions that were impactful to students.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I transitioned into college, my peer mentors were so impactful to me as a Tippie student, and I wanted to provide the same experience to other incoming students. I still love being able to connect with students from my classes and by being a friendly face to say hi to.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Business Student Ambassador</h3>
        <p>
          As a business student ambassador, I guide prospective students and families on tours of the Tippie College of Business. I also share my upper-level business student perspective by serving as a student panelist.
        </p>
        <p>
          Being able to work with prospective Tippie students has been one of the most rewarding parts of my college experience; I share why I chose to come to the University of Iowa, what I am learning in my classes, and why I chose to study Marketing Analytics and Business Analytics. I also remember the impact my tour guides and student ambassadors had on me when I visited in high school and hope to have the same impact on students.
