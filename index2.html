      <h2>Marketing Institute</h2>

      <p>
        In the last three semesters of my college career, I was selected as one of the top 20 marketing students to participate in a field immersion program called the Marketing Institute to work on marketing consulting projects for real clients.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the Fall of 2023 and this Spring, I have been working with Bobbi-Toads, a children's apparel company. My team is working on conducting primary market research, in the form of a Qualtrics survey and focus groups, to understand parents' preferences in purchasing children's footwear and opinions about Bobbi-Toads products.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the Spring of 2023, my team created rebranding and strategy guidelines for Growthland and Good Shepherd Center, both local Iowa City businesses. My team's work was chosen by Growthland to be implemented as part of its new marketing strategy.
